lier than amyloid pathology and, contrary to most of the previous studies, it seems that tau may be responsible for initiation of the disease process in AD
(Yoshida and oth- ers 2019). Following the failure of anti-amyloid therapies for AD, 
various radiotracers have been developed recently to target tau pathology,
lead to paradigm shift toward tau as a thera- peutic target (Giacobini and Gold 2013).
The earliest radiotracer to target tau in vivo was [18F]-labeled THK-523 or ([ 18F]-6-(2-fluoroethoxy)-2-(4-aminophenyl)quinoline) but unfortunately, 
a very high retention in white matter pre- cludes its use in research or clinical trials (Fodero-Tavoletti and others 2011; Villemagne and others 2014). 
Furthermore, several [18F]-labeled arylquinoline derivatives were devel- oped as candidate tau PET radiotracers such as 
[18F]THK- 5105 and [ 18F]-THK-5117 (Harada and others 2015; Okamura and others 2014).
 [ 18F]THK-5351, a recent radiotracer, has shown to improve tau binding affinity with
